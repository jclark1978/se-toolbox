# SE Toolbox

SE Toolbox is a static, browser-only suite of utilities for common Fortinet SE workflows. It currently includes SKU Finder, BOM Builder, Hardware LifeCycle lookup, Software LifeCycle lookup, Ordering Guides lookup, Asset Reports, and the Lab Portal Generator.

## Features

- SKU Finder for pricelist ingestion, search, export, and BOM building
- BOM Builder as an upstream-friendly FabricBOM integration wrapped in the SE Toolbox shell
- Hardware LifeCycle lookup for milestone and support-planning searches using the Fortinet RSS feed
- Software LifeCycle lookup for release and support milestone searches using the Fortinet RSS feed
- Ordering Guides lookup for cross-referencing guides and related products
- Asset Report generation from customer workbook inputs
- Lab Portal Generator for demo portal handoff workflows
- IndexedDB persistence and optional offline-capable caching

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

No build step or package install is required. All vendor dependencies are vendored in `/vendor`.

### 2. Run locally

Serve the project root with any static file server. One simple option:

```bash
python -m http.server 5173
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in a modern browser.

### 3. Deploy

Upload the contents of this repository to any static host:

- **GitHub Pages:** push the folder to a `gh-pages` branch.
- **Netlify/Vercel:** drag-and-drop the folder or point the site to it.
- **S3/CloudFront, Firebase Hosting, nginx, etc.:** copy the folder as-is.

No backend or server-side computation is required.

## Project Layout

- `index.html` is the main SE Toolbox landing page and hosts the shared price-list and SKU Finder workflow.
- `bom-builder/`, `hardware-lifecycle/`, `software-lifecycle/`, `ordering-guides/`, `asset-reports/`, and `lab-portal/` each contain a page entrypoint for a separate workflow.
- `src/features/` groups browser logic by product surface:
  - `sku-finder/`
  - `bom-builder/` for the FabricBOM-backed BOM Builder wrapper and bridge assets
  - `hardware-lifecycle/` for the RSS-based hardware lifecycle flow
  - `software-lifecycle/` for the RSS-based software lifecycle flow
  - `ordering-guides/`
  - `asset-reports/`
- `src/shared/data/` contains workbook/search/storage helpers shared across pages.
- `src/shared/lifecycle/` contains shared lifecycle controller and search helpers used by both lifecycle tools.
- `src/shared/ui/` contains shared shell assets such as theme handling, nav generation, and shared toolbox page styling.
- `vendor/` contains vendored browser dependencies.

## Documentation

- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` is a root pointer to the fuller project summary in `docs/project/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`.
- `DESIGN.md` is a root pointer to the design concept docs in `docs/design-concepts/`.
- `docs/design-concepts/DESIGN-FORTIGATE.md` captures the FortiGate / Tactical Precision design language.
- `docs/design-concepts/DESIGN-SOLTESZ.md` captures the Soltesz / Precision Ledger design language.

Primary routes are:

- `/`
- `/bom-builder/`
- `/hardware-lifecycle/`
- `/software-lifecycle/`
- `/ordering-guides/`
- `/asset-reports/`
- `/lab-portal/`

The optional `/fortisku/` route can be kept as a compatibility alias, but `/` remains the primary SE Toolbox entrypoint.

Legacy top-level page URLs such as `asset-report.html` are kept only as lightweight redirects for backward compatibility.

## Usage Notes

1. Open `/` to start in the main SE Toolbox workspace, then use SKU Finder or jump to the other tools from the shared navigation.
2. Open `/bom-builder/` for the BOM Builder integration preview, which wraps a vendored FabricBOM workspace inside the SE Toolbox shell.
3. In SKU Finder, upload an Excel workbook (.xlsx). By default, the app targets the `DataSet` sheet; provide an alternative sheet name if needed.
4. The workbook is parsed entirely in the browser. SKU Finder auto-detects the first row containing SKU/Description headers (so banner rows can stay) and skips rows lacking SKU or Description #1.
5. After the first upload, the normalized rows, MiniSearch index, and metadata persist in IndexedDB. Reloading the page resumes instantly.
6. Use spaces for AND searches across Description #1/#2 (e.g. `FortiGate 90G Enterprise bdl`). Add `OR` (or `|`) for alternatives, such as `FortiGate (90G OR 70F) Enterprise bdl`. Results are capped at 200 rows for fast rendering.
7. Use the `+` button beside any SKU to add it to the BOM. Quantities are prompted on add, and you can adjust them from the drawer. A `–` button removes the SKU; the drawer also offers a trash icon per line.
8. Export either the full dataset or the visible search results to CSV at any time.

## Storage & Clearing Data

- IndexedDB persistence means large datasets consume browser storage. Most browsers allow hundreds of megabytes, but quotas vary.
- The dataset panel shows an approximate byte size (rows + index JSON).
- Use **Clear stored data** to wipe IndexedDB entries and return to an empty state. You can also clear site data from browser settings if needed.

All operations remain client-side. Data never leaves the user's machine, ensuring portability and offline resilience.
