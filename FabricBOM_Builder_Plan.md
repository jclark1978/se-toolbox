# FabricBOM Builder Integration Plan

## Goal

Keep BOM Builder as a native-feeling SE Toolbox page while using `FabricBOM` as an upstream-synced embedded workspace.

The current direction is:

- SE Toolbox owns the route, shell, navigation, and theme behavior
- `FabricBOM` owns the embedded BOM workspace and product generators
- the shared workbook-derived dataset remains the pricing source of truth
- local integration patches stay thin and deliberate

## Current State

As of this migration pass:

- the vendored upstream snapshot has been refreshed from `msalty/FabricBOM`
- the BOM Builder wrapper still embeds the vendored app through `/bom-builder/`
- SE Toolbox navigation can now reach the newer upstream products
- pricing is being standardized onto a shared IndexedDB dataset contract
- the theme bridge has been expanded to cover the newer upstream shell controls

Current local integration points:

- `bom-builder/index.html`
- `src/features/bom-builder/main.js`
- `src/features/bom-builder/catalog.js`
- `src/features/bom-builder/theme-bridge.css`
- `vendor/FortiBOM/`

Note:

- the vendored folder path remains `vendor/FortiBOM/` for now to avoid a larger path and cache refactor during the upstream migration
- user-facing naming in SE Toolbox should use `FabricBOM`

## Architecture Decision

Do not import `FabricBOM` wholesale into the SE Toolbox shell.

Do not rewrite the whole tool natively yet either.

The best fit right now is an adapter-style integration:

- SE Toolbox owns the surrounding experience
- `FabricBOM` stays vendored as the upstream BOM engine
- local patches focus on wrapper behavior, theme bridging, and pricing integration

This gives us:

- a realistic path for future upstream refreshes
- a consistent SE Toolbox user experience
- less duplicated logic
- an easier future migration path if selected products become native modules later

## Ownership Split

SE Toolbox-owned:

- route and wrapper page
- shared navigation and shell
- theme synchronization
- embedded-frame control logic
- product catalog mapping for SE Toolbox navigation
- local documentation and migration workflow

FabricBOM-owned initially:

- upstream hub shell and product iframe loader
- per-product generators
- Project BOM semantics
- import/export behavior
- local storage/session behavior

Shared boundary:

- iframe host in `bom-builder/index.html`
- embedded control hooks used by the wrapper:
  - `loadProduct()`
  - `showPBV()`
  - `showSavedProjects()`
- postMessage add-to-BOM flow
- shared dataset IndexedDB access

## Shared Data Contract

The long-term interoperability boundary between SE Toolbox and upstream `FabricBOM` is a shared browser-only IndexedDB contract.

Use:

- DB name: `toolbox_shared`
- schema version: `1`
- object store: `datasets`

Dataset keys:

- `pricing`
- `hardware_lifecycle`
- `software_lifecycle`

### Dataset Envelope

Each dataset record stored in `datasets` should follow this shape:

```js
{
  key: "pricing",
  version: 1,
  source: {
    app: "FortiSKU" | "FabricBOM" | string,
    format: "xlsx" | "rss" | string,
    label: string | null,
    importedAt: "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    effectiveDate: string | null
  },
  data: {
    rows: []
  },
  meta: {
    rowCount: number,
    schema: "toolbox_shared.pricing.v1"
  }
}
```

### Shared Pricing Row Shape

The normalized `pricing` dataset rows should use:

```js
{
  sku: string,
  description1: string,
  description2: string,
  price: number | null,
  priceDisplay: string,
  category: string,
  comments: string
}
```

### Shared Lifecycle Row Shape

The normalized lifecycle datasets should use:

```js
{
  product: string,
  release: string,
  milestone: string,
  date: string,
  details: string,
  sourceUrl: string
}
```

## Pricing Model

Pricing must continue to come from the shared workbook-derived dataset rather than a separate BOM-only pricing workflow.

Current integration behavior:

- SKU Finder workbook import is the canonical pricing source
- FortiSKU publishes normalized pricing rows into `toolbox_shared` / `datasets` / `pricing`
- embedded `FabricBOM` should read that normalized dataset from IndexedDB
- Project BOM pricing and custom SKU lookup should depend on that shared store
- FabricBOM standalone mode may also import the same workbook format and write into the same shared dataset contract

Practical rule:

- preserve the shared dataset seam during upstream refreshes
- do not reintroduce a separate CSV-based or BOM-only pricing workflow unless intentionally approved
- do not couple FabricBOM to FortiSKU's internal feature keys such as `fortisku-finder:*`

## Workbook Pricing Import Contract

For interoperability, both tools should normalize pricing from the same workbook-style source contract.

Required behavior:

- target default sheet name: `DataSet`
- if `DataSet` is absent, fall back to the first sheet
- detect the header row dynamically rather than assuming the first row
- require both SKU and primary description columns
- accept header synonyms
- skip empty rows
- trim and sanitize string values
- parse numeric price when possible
- preserve the original display string for price
- sort normalized rows by `sku`

Header mapping:

- `sku`: `sku`, `product_sku`, `part`, `partnumber`
- `description1`: `description`, `description#1`, `description1`, `desc`, `itemdescription`, `productdescription`
- `description2`: `description#2`, `description2`, `desc2`, `itemdescription2`, `productdescription2`, `secondarydescription`
- `price`: `price`, `listprice`, `unitprice`, `msrp`, `usdprice`
- `category`: `category`, `productcategory`, `family`, `productfamily`, `familyname`, `productline`, `bundle`, `solution`, `segment`, `portfolio`
- `comments`: `comments`, `comment`, `notes`, `note`

Workbook metadata behavior:

- if a workbook contains `Cover Sheet`, `Cover`, or `Coversheet`, read cell `C7` when present and use it as `source.label`
- set `source.format = "xlsx"`
- set `source.importedAt` to the import timestamp

Practical rule:

- treat the workbook import pipeline as the only shared pricing source of truth
- if upstream FabricBOM historically supported CSV pricing import, that should not be reintroduced as the shared workflow after refreshes

## Upstream Refresh Workflow

Recommended workflow for future updates:

1. refresh the vendored snapshot from `msalty/FabricBOM`
2. compare upstream changes against local wrapper assumptions and the shared data contract
3. preserve only the minimum local integration patches
4. verify:
   - embedded route loads
   - product navigation still works
   - Project BOM still works
   - Saved Projects still works
   - workbook-based shared pricing still resolves through `toolbox_shared`
   - custom SKU search still resolves against normalized pricing rows
   - service worker asset list still matches vendored files
   - no refresh reintroduces legacy `fabricbom_pricing` dependence
5. update this plan if the boundary changes

Practical rule:

- do not scatter `FabricBOM` edits across unrelated SE Toolbox files
- keep local changes concentrated in the wrapper, catalog bridge, theme bridge, shared dataset seam, and carefully chosen vendor patches

## What Must Remain Stable Across Upstream Pulls

When pulling a newer upstream `FabricBOM` snapshot, protect these integration expectations:

- FabricBOM reads pricing from `toolbox_shared` rather than `fabricbom_pricing`
- FabricBOM expects normalized `pricing` rows with `sku`, `description1`, `description2`, `price`, `priceDisplay`, `category`, and `comments`
- FabricBOM standalone pricing import uses the workbook flow rather than a CSV-only path
- Custom SKU search uses the normalized pricing dataset
- Project BOM totals use the normalized numeric `price` field
- BOM wrapper copy should continue describing pricing as shared workbook-backed data

If an upstream pull breaks any of these seams, restore the seam rather than pushing FabricBOM-specific storage rules deeper into FortiSKU.

## Naming Convention

Use `FabricBOM` in:

- SE Toolbox page copy
- README and project docs
- planning and migration docs
- status and UI messaging where the embedded tool is referenced by name

The legacy filesystem path `vendor/FortiBOM/` can remain temporarily until we intentionally perform a follow-up vendor-path rename.

That later rename should be treated as its own cleanup task because it will affect:

- wrapper iframe paths
- service worker cached URLs
- root service worker asset lists
- documentation references

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Stable Upstream Wrapper

Keep the current wrapper-based integration healthy:

- SE Toolbox shell around embedded `FabricBOM`
- shared navigation into products and views
- shared workbook-backed dataset contract
- service-worker and asset alignment
- thin local styling bridge

Status:

- in progress and now materially advanced

### Phase 2: Harden The Boundary

Improve the wrapper and maintenance model:

- record upstream commit/version in a lightweight note if needed
- isolate any vendor patches we intentionally carry
- add a small validation checklist for upstream refreshes
- reduce stale `FortiBOM` naming in local docs and UI
- keep the shared dataset adapter seam narrow and well documented

### Phase 3: Selective Native Replacement

Only if it proves valuable, replace selected upstream product flows with native SE Toolbox modules.

Good candidates later:

- FortiGate
- FortiSwitch
- FortiAP

Criteria before replacing a product natively:

- the upstream flow is stable and well understood
- the SE Toolbox version would materially improve usability or maintainability
- the module can still emit normalized BOM rows compatible with the shared cart/export model

### Phase 4: Optional Vendor Path Cleanup

If we want naming consistency all the way down, rename the vendored folder from `vendor/FortiBOM/` to something like `vendor/FabricBOM/`.

Do this only as a deliberate follow-up after:

- wrapper paths are updated together
- cache keys and cached asset paths are updated together
- docs and references are updated together

## Immediate Next Steps

1. smoke-test `/bom-builder/` in the browser
2. verify one standard product flow end to end
3. verify `Search & Custom Entry` against the shared workbook-derived pricing dataset
4. verify Project BOM pricing/export behavior
5. verify no legacy CSV-only pricing assumptions remain after upstream refresh
6. decide whether to keep the vendor path as-is for now or schedule the path rename as a separate cleanup pass

## Strong Recommendation

Keep BOM Builder on the current path:

- upstream-synced `FabricBOM`
- SE Toolbox-owned shell
- shared workbook-derived pricing dataset via `toolbox_shared`
- minimal, well-contained integration patches

That is the best balance of maintainability, upgradeability, and speed right now.
