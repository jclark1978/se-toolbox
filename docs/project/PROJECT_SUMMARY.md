# Project Summary

## Overview

SE Toolbox is a static, browser-only toolkit for working with Fortinet data and lightweight internal workflows. It runs entirely client-side, uses no backend, and can be served from any simple static host.

The project started as a SKU finder and has grown into a small suite of related tools for a Fortinet SE:

- SKU Finder
- BOM Builder
- Hardware LifeCycle lookup
- Software LifeCycle lookup
- Ordering Guides lookup
- Asset Report builder
- Lab Portal Generator

All workbook processing happens in the browser. Persisted data is stored locally in IndexedDB, and vendored browser dependencies are included directly in the repository.

## Current Architecture

The codebase is now organized by feature instead of keeping every page module flat in `src/`.

### Top-level pages

- `index.html`
  - Main SKU Finder page and current toolbox landing page
- `fortisku/`
  - Optional compatibility alias for the SKU Finder route
- `bom-builder/`
  - Canonical BOM Builder integration preview page
- `hardware-lifecycle/`
  - Canonical Hardware LifeCycle lookup page
- `software-lifecycle/`
  - Canonical Software LifeCycle lookup page
- `ordering-guides/`
  - Canonical Ordering Guides page
- `asset-reports/`
  - Canonical Asset Report builder page
- `lab-portal/`
  - Canonical Lab Portal Generator page

Primary browser routes are:

- `/`
- `/bom-builder/`
- `/hardware-lifecycle/`
- `/software-lifecycle/`
- `/ordering-guides/`
- `/asset-reports/`
- `/lab-portal/`

Legacy page URLs are still present only as lightweight redirect files for backward compatibility:

- `ordering.html`
- `asset-report.html`
- `Lab-Portal-Generator.html`

### Source layout

- `src/features/sku-finder/`
  - Main SKU Finder logic, UI, BOM support
- `src/features/bom-builder/`
  - FortiBOM-backed wrapper route, adapter logic, and theme bridge assets
- `src/features/hardware-lifecycle/`
  - Hardware LifeCycle parsing, storage, search, UI
- `src/features/software-lifecycle/`
  - Software LifeCycle parsing, storage, search, UI
- `src/shared/lifecycle/`
  - Shared lifecycle controller and search helpers used by both lifecycle tools
- `src/features/ordering-guides/`
  - Ordering Guide page logic and UI
- `src/features/asset-reports/`
  - Asset workbook inspection and report generation
- `src/shared/data/`
  - Shared ingestion, search, storage, and CSV helpers
- `src/shared/ui/`
  - Shared UI helpers like theme handling, toolbox navigation, and shared page-shell styling
- `vendor/`
  - Vendored client-side dependencies:
    - `xlsx`
    - `minisearch`
    - `idb-keyval`

## Main Workflows

### 1. SKU Finder

Primary page: `index.html`

Purpose:
- Upload a Fortinet price list workbook
- Normalize workbook data into a standard SKU row format
- Build a client-side search index
- Search SKU and description data quickly
- Export full results or filtered results to CSV
- Build a bill of materials with quantity and discount support

Key modules:
- `src/features/sku-finder/main.js`
- `src/features/sku-finder/ui.js`
- `src/features/sku-finder/bom.js`
- `src/features/sku-finder/bomExport.js`
- `src/shared/data/ingest.js`
- `src/shared/data/search.js`
- `src/shared/data/storage.js`
- `src/shared/data/csv.js`

### 2. BOM Builder

Primary page: `bom-builder/index.html`

Purpose:
- Provide an SE Toolbox-native wrapper around a vendored FortiBOM workspace
- Keep BOM-building inside the shared SE Toolbox shell and navigation
- Preserve a cleaner path for future upstream FortiBOM updates

Key modules:
- `src/features/bom-builder/main.js`
- `src/features/bom-builder/page.css`
- `src/features/bom-builder/theme-bridge.css`
- `vendor/FortiBOM/`

### 3. Hardware LifeCycle Lookup

Primary page: `hardware-lifecycle/index.html`

Purpose:
- Refresh hardware lifecycle data from the Fortinet RSS feed
- Import RSS XML through a guided modal workflow
- Store normalized lifecycle rows in IndexedDB
- Search lifecycle-specific records through a dedicated UI

Key modules:
- `src/features/hardware-lifecycle/main.js`
- `src/features/hardware-lifecycle/rss.js`
- `src/features/hardware-lifecycle/search.js`
- `src/features/hardware-lifecycle/storage.js`
- `src/features/hardware-lifecycle/ui.js`
- `src/shared/lifecycle/app.js`
- `src/shared/lifecycle/search.js`

### 4. Software LifeCycle Lookup

Primary page: `software-lifecycle/index.html`

Purpose:
- Refresh software lifecycle data from the Fortinet RSS feed
- Import RSS XML through a guided modal workflow
- Store normalized lifecycle rows in IndexedDB
- Search software release-specific records through a dedicated UI

Key modules:
- `src/features/software-lifecycle/main.js`
- `src/features/software-lifecycle/rss.js`
- `src/features/software-lifecycle/search.js`
- `src/features/software-lifecycle/storage.js`
- `src/features/software-lifecycle/ui.js`
- `src/shared/lifecycle/app.js`
- `src/shared/lifecycle/search.js`

### 5. Ordering Guides

Primary page: `ordering-guides/index.html`

Purpose:
- Reuse uploaded price list data
- Extract ordering guide rows
- Search ordering guide and related product text

Key modules:
- `src/features/ordering-guides/main.js`
- `src/features/ordering-guides/ui.js`
- `src/shared/data/ingest.js`
- `src/shared/data/storage.js`

### 6. Asset Reports

Primary page: `asset-reports/index.html`

Purpose:
- Load an asset workbook
- Inspect and summarize source data
- Generate an output workbook for customer-facing reporting

Key modules:
- `src/features/asset-reports/main.js`
- `src/features/asset-reports/ui.js`
- `src/features/asset-reports/workbook.js`

### 7. Lab Portal Generator

Primary page: `lab-portal/index.html`

Purpose:
- Provide a standalone browser-based generator workflow for lab portal content

Notes:
- This page remains largely self-contained in HTML today and may be a good candidate for future extraction into `src/features/lab-portal/` if it grows further.

## Storage and Runtime Model

- No backend services are required
- No build step is required
- The app can be served using `python3 -m http.server`
- IndexedDB is used for persisted workbook/search data
- A service worker in `sw.js` provides optional offline caching

## Deployment

Deployment is currently handled as a static site through GitHub and Azure Static Web Apps workflows in `.github/workflows/`.

## Security and Data Handling

- Workbook data stays client-side during app use
- `Sample_Files/` is now ignored by git and no longer tracked
- Sensitive example files should not be committed back into the repository
- If older sensitive files were committed previously, they still remain in git history unless history is rewritten separately
